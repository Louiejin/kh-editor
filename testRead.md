# Senior Full Stack Software Engineer Coding Challenge
#### Solution Summary
- I separated the Frontend and Backend. On the backend I used `expressjs` to create the server, add `express-basic-auth` for security layer that only and authorized client-side web app can access the backend. Lastly I used the api given by the newsapi.org (`newsapi`) to fetch the news RSS Feeds from newsapi.org. On the frontend I `Reactjs`, `Material-Ui` for the design and `axios` to connect the frontend to the backend.
#### How to run the web app
- Backend
-- go to where the downloaded file is located using the cmd/terminal `(../Senior_Full_Stack_Software_Engineer_Coding Challenge/server )`
-- on the terminal type `npm start` this will run the backend on localhost port 3001
- Frontend
-- This can run in two way
